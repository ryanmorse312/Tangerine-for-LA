                <h2>Tangerine County</h2>

                <p>This is where Paul's family moved while following "The Erik Fisher Football Dream". It is a small town in florida that used to be dedicated to growing tangerines, but now the ecosystem has changed due mostly due the awful weather. It is almost always raining and storming which forces different living conditions. Very different from the town in Houston, Texas that he used to live in. The school he goes to is made mostly of small sheds for classrooms in case of a flood.</p>

                <h2>The Muck Fire</h2>

                <p>The definition of "Muck Fire" supplied by Google is; " A soil rich in carbon-based compounds from dead plants and organisms that stays burning for a long period of time. A muck fire ignites from the burning brush above and lightning strikes. Enough oxygen penetrates the parched, loosely packed peat, causing under ground embers to smolder for weeks." The muck fire in the story is in the Fishers' neighborhood and was seen as a bad thing. This acts as symbolism. It shows that this place or something in this place, like, say, Erik, is bad, and will always be bad.</p>

                <h2>Soccer</h2>

                <p>Erik may have Football, but Paul has Soccer. Soccer is Paul's favorite sport and shows that even in all of this bad, there can be good. Paul, despite being legally blind, is a very good goalkeeper. The fact that Paul's parents don't seem to notice that much but celebrate Erik's skill in Football also shows another bad thing in the book. I, personally, like this because all of the bad things in the book really made you pay attention and really brought emphasis to all of the good things that happened.</p>
